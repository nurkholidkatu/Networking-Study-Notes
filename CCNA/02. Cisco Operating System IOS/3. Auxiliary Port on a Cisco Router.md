# Auxiliary Port on a Cisco Router

Most Cisco routers include an **Auxiliary (Aux) port**, which serves as a **backup asynchronous (async) port**.  
This port is commonly used for **remote router management via dial-up modem connections**, especially in older or backup network setups.

Think of the Aux port as a "remote version" of the **console port**.  
- The **console port** is for direct local access (using a console cable).  
- The **auxiliary port** allows you to do almost the same thing, but **remotely through a telephone line and modem**.

## ðŸ”¹ Purpose of the Auxiliary Port
1. **Remote Access (Dial-Up)** â€“ Before SSH became common, administrators could dial into a router using a modem connected to the aux port.  
2. **Backup Management** â€“ If the main network goes down, admins can still connect to the router through the phone line.  
3. **Out-of-Band Management** â€“ Provides management access outside of the primary data network.

## ðŸ”¹ How It Works
1. A **modem** is connected to the routerâ€™s **Aux port**.  
2. The network administrator uses a **terminal emulation program** (like PuTTY, HyperTerminal, or Tera Term) on their PC.  
3. The admin **dials the routerâ€™s modem number** via the telephone line.  
4. The modem forwards the connection to the routerâ€™s **Aux port**.  
5. The administrator is then presented with the **Cisco IOS CLI** (Command-Line Interface).

## ðŸ”¹ Configuration Example

To enable access through the auxiliary port:

```bash
Router> enable
Router# configure terminal
Router(config)# line aux 0
Router(config-line)# password cisco
Router(config-line)# login
Router(config-line)# exit
Router(config)# exit
Router#
