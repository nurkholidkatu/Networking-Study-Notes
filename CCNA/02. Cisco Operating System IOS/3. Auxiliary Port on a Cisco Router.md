# Auxiliary Port on a Cisco Router

Most Cisco routers include an additional **auxiliary (Aux) port** as a backup asynchronous port.  
This port is commonly used as a **dial-up port for remote router management**.  
It is connected to a modem and enables an administrator to make a phone call to connect to the routerâ€™s CLI.

## How It Works
- The Aux port acts as an alternative to the console port.  
- A modem is connected to the Aux port, and the administrator uses a **terminal emulation program** to access the router.  
- This provides remote management even when the network is unavailable.

## Configuration Example

```bash
Router(config)#line aux 0
Router(config-line)#password cisco
Router(config-line)#login
