## What is an Interface?

In Cisco IOS, an **interface** refers to a physical port on a device (router or switch). You configure different settings depending on whether the interface is on a router or a switch.

- **Slot 1** â€“ Network card expansion slot for additional interface cards.
- **Kensington slot** â€“ Physical security lock point.
- **FastEthernet 0/1** â€“ Ethernet port + status LED.
- **Console port** â€“ Direct CLI access using a console cable.
- **Slot 0** â€“ Another expansion slot (numbering right-to-left).
- **CompactFlash slot** â€“ IOS image source.
- **USB port** â€“ File transfer with a USB drive.
- **FastEthernet 0/0** â€“ Ethernet port + status LED.
- **AUX port** â€“ Legacy modem for out-of-band management.
- **Power & switch** â€“ On/Off and power input socket.

## Quick Commands

Run these from **Privileged EXEC** (prompt ends with `#`).

- `show ip interface brief` â€” list interfaces, IPs and status
- `configure terminal` â€” enter global config mode
- `interface FastEthernet0/0` â€” enter interface sub-mode
- `no shutdown` â€” enable an interface (routers only)

---

## Configure Example

```
Router(config)# interface f0/0
Router(config-if)# ip address 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.0
Router(config-if)# no shutdown
%LINK-5-CHANGED: Interface FastEthernet0/0, changed state to up
%LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface FastEthernet0/0, changed state to up
```

---

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** On switches, ports are usually *up* by default. On routers, you must enable interfaces with `no shutdown`.

---

## Example: `show ip interface brief`

```
Interface              IP-Address      OK? Method Status                Protocol
FastEthernet0/0        192.168.0.1     YES manual administratively down down
FastEthernet0/1        unassigned      YES unset  administratively down down
Vlan1                  unassigned      YES unset  administratively down down
```

### Column Guide

| Column     | Meaning                                                         |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Interface  | Port type and slot/port numbers (e.g., FastEthernet0/0)         |
| IP-Address | Configured IP or *unassigned*                                   |
| OK?        | Is IP valid? (YES/NO)                                           |
| Method     | How IP was set (manual/DHCP)                                    |
| Status     | Administrative state (up / administratively down)               |
| Protocol   | Operational state of line protocol (up / down)                  |

## Summary

Interfaces are physical ports. Use `show ip interface brief` to check status, and `no shutdown` to enable router ports.
