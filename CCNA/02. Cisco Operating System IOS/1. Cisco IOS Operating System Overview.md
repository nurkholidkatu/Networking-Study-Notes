# Cisco IOS Operating System Overview

Cisco IOS (Internetwork Operating System) is a multitasking operating system used on most Cisco Systems routers and switches. IOS provides a command-line interface (CLI) with a set of multiple-word commands. It is used to configure **routing, switching, internetworking**, and other features supported by Cisco IOS devices.

> **Note:**  
> Previous versions of Cisco switches used **CatOS**, a legacy CLI-based operating system.

## Example: Cisco 3745 Bootup

Below is an example of how Cisco IOS looks when a Cisco device starts for the first time, using a **Cisco 3745 router** as reference:

Cisco 3745 (R7000) processor (revision 2.0) with 249856K/12288K bytes of memory.
Processor board ID FTX0945W0MY
R7000 CPU at 350MHz, Implementation 39, Rev 2.1, 256KB L2, 512KB L3 Cache
5 FastEthernet interfaces
DRAM configuration is 64 bits wide with parity enabled.
151K bytes of NVRAM.

## Accessing Cisco IOS

There are **three main ways** to access the Cisco IOS:

### 1. Console Access
- Used mainly for newly acquired devices (no IP address configured yet).  
- Devices have a **physical console port**.  
- Requires a **rollover cable** (serial cable with reversed pins).  
- Usually connected via a **9-pin serial interface â†’ RJ-45 adapter**.  
- Newer devices often provide a **USB console port** (since many PCs no longer include serial ports).

---

### 2. Telnet Access
- A remote access method using the network.  
- Requires:
  - An IP address configured on the device.  
  - A Telnet server enabled on the device.  
- Uses **TCP port 23**.  
- **Disadvantage:** All traffic (including passwords) is sent as **clear text**.  
- **Nowadays replaced by SSH** due to security concerns.

---

### 3. SSH (Secure Shell) Access
- Works similarly to Telnet but with **encryption** for secure remote configuration.  
- Uses **public-key cryptography** to secure communication.  
- Runs on **TCP port 22**.  
- Considered the **standard secure method** to access network devices remotely.

## Cisco IOS Modes

IOS provides several modes, but the most important ones are:

| **Mode** | **Access Method** | **Capabilities** |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| **User EXEC Mode** | Default login mode | Basic commands only (e.g., `ping`, `telnet`) |
| **Privileged EXEC Mode** | Enter with `enable` command | View/change configurations; can be password protected |
| **Global Configuration Mode** | Enter with `configure terminal` from Privileged EXEC | Modify device configuration |
| **Interface Configuration Sub-mode** | From Global Config: `interface FastEthernet 0/1` | Configure specific interface settings |

## Summary
Cisco IOS is the core operating system for Cisco routers and switches. It provides different **access methods** (Console, Telnet, SSH) and various **operating modes** (User EXEC, Privileged EXEC, Global Configuration, Sub-modes). Understanding how to access and navigate IOS is the foundation for configuring and managing Cisco devices.
