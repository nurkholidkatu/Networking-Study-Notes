# Encapsulation in OSI and TCP/IP Models

## 1. What is Encapsulation?
**Encapsulation** is the process of adding extra information (headers and sometimes trailers) around data as it moves down through the layers of a network model.  
- Each layer adds control information needed for communication.  
- At the receiver’s side, the process is reversed, called **decapsulation** (headers/trailers are removed).

## 2. Encapsulation in the TCP/IP Model

When you send data (for example, an email), it moves through the **four layers** of the TCP/IP model:

1. **Application Layer**  
   - Creates the data (e.g., email content) and sends it to the Transport layer.  

2. **Transport Layer**  
   - Adds a **header** with port numbers, sequencing, and reliability info.  
   - The output is called a **Segment**.  

3. **Internet Layer**  
   - Adds a **header** with **IP addresses** (source and destination).  
   - The output is called a **Packet**.  

4. **Network Access Layer**  
   - Adds a **header and a trailer** (with MAC addresses, error checking).  
   - The output is called a **Frame**.  
   - The frame is converted into **Bits** and transmitted physically over the network.

### TCP/IP Encapsulation Example

| **Layer**              | **Added Info**                           | **Data Unit (PDU)** |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Application             | Data created by apps (email, web, etc.)  | Data                |
| Transport               | Port numbers, sequencing, reliability    | Segment             |
| Internet                | Source and destination IP addresses      | Packet              |
| Network Access          | MAC addresses, error checking, trailer   | Frame (→ Bits)      |

## 3. Encapsulation in the OSI Model

The **OSI model** works the same way but has **7 layers** instead of 4.  
Each layer adds a **header** (and the Data Link layer adds a **trailer**).

- OSI uses the term **PDU (Protocol Data Unit)** for the encapsulated data at each layer.  
- Each layer’s PDU has a specific name.

### OSI Encapsulation PDUs

| **Layer (OSI)**          | **Encapsulated Info**                     | **PDU Name** |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Layer 7: Application      | App data (files, emails, web pages)        | Data         |
| Layer 6: Presentation     | Data formatting, encryption, compression   | Data         |
| Layer 5: Session          | Communication sessions (start/stop)        | Data         |
| Layer 4: Transport        | Ports, reliability, sequencing             | Segment      |
| Layer 3: Network          | Logical addressing (IP addresses)          | Packet       |
| Layer 2: Data Link        | Physical addressing (MAC), error checking  | Frame        |
| Layer 1: Physical         | Electrical/optical/radio signals           | Bits         |

## 4. Encapsulation vs Decapsulation

- **Encapsulation**:  
  - Happens on the **sender’s side**.  
  - Each layer **adds a header (and sometimes trailer)** around the data.  

- **Decapsulation**:  
  - Happens on the **receiver’s side**.  
  - Each layer **removes its header/trailer**, passing the remaining data up.

## 5. Key Differences: TCP/IP vs OSI

| **Aspect**               | **TCP/IP Model**                        | **OSI Model**                |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Number of Layers          | 4                                       | 7                             |
| Terminology for Data      | Segment → Packet → Frame                | PDU (Data, Segment, Packet, Frame, Bits) |
| Trailer Added At          | Network Access layer                    | Data Link layer               |
| Used In Practice?         | Yes (Internet uses TCP/IP)              | Mostly theoretical/reference  |

## 6. Summary

- **Encapsulation**: Wrapping data with headers (and trailers) as it moves down the layers.  
- **Decapsulation**: Removing headers and trailers as data moves up at the receiver.  
- **TCP/IP model**: 4 layers → Data, Segment, Packet, Frame.  
- **OSI model**: 7 layers → Data, Segment, Packet, Frame, Bits.  
- Both models describe how data travels from an application on one device to another across a network.
