# TCP/IP Protocol Suite

The **TCP/IP protocol suite** is the set of communication rules (protocols) that make computer networks work, especially the Internet.  
It defines **how data is prepared, sent, transmitted, routed, and received** across networks.  

To make things organized, TCP/IP is divided into **four layers**. Each layer has its own role, and different protocols work at different layers.

The name **TCP/IP** comes from its two most important protocols:  
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**  
- **IP (Internet Protocol)**  

But there are many more protocols included in the suite. Here are some of the most common ones:

- **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** – finds the MAC address that belongs to a specific IP address.  
- **IP (Internet Protocol)** – delivers packets from the source computer to the destination computer using IP addresses.  
- **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)** – reports errors and network problems (used in the `ping` command).  
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** – connection-based; ensures reliable and ordered delivery of data.  
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** – connectionless; sends data quickly but without guaranteed delivery.  
- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)** – used to transfer files between computers.  
- **Telnet (Telecommunications Network)** – allows remote login and command execution on another computer.  
- **DNS (Domain Name System)** – translates hostnames (like `www.google.com`) into IP addresses.  
- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** – transfers web content such as text, images, audio, video, and other media on the World Wide Web.

## TCP/IP Layers and Protocols

Here’s how the main protocols fit into the four TCP/IP layers:

| **Layer**              | **Protocols**                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Application Layer**   | HTTP, FTP, Telnet, DNS                                                       |
| **Transport Layer**     | TCP, UDP                                                                     |
| **Internet Layer**      | IP, ICMP, ARP                                                                |
| **Network Access Layer**| Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and hardware-related protocols (not listed in detail above) |

### Key Takeaway
The **TCP/IP model** is the foundation of today’s Internet. Each layer and protocol has a specific function, but they all work together to make communication between computers possible.
